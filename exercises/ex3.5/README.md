## Troubleshoot

1. No data in rich text editor, Execute prompt `Add mock data for travel notes`

2. Travel notes is not a Rich Text Editor.
Execute prompt `use "RichTextEditor"`. Verify `RichTextEditor`  in the xml fragment.

![notrichtext](./images/not-rich-text.png)

for example
```
        <macros:RichTextEditor
            id="travelNotesEditor"
            value="{TravelNotes}"/>
```

3. Cannot edit travel notes RichTextEditor building block. Execute prompt `Travel notes with RichTextEditor is not editable`
