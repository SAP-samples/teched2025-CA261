## Troubleshoot

- Does not appear as dropdown. execute prompt `travel status filter is not a dropdown`

- If travel status dropdown contains UUID. You can remove it by executing prompt
  `Configure UUID/GUID as External ID in travel status dropdown. use fiori mcp`.
   When the task is complete. Verify  Common.ExternalID annotation is applied on travel status to hide UUID.

For example:
```
annotate service.Travels with {
    to_Status @(
        Common.ExternalID : to_Status.Name
    )
};
```
