4. Press `Enter` to start the task.
5. Cline will generate an **Implementation Plan**.
6. Review the plan once it's ready. 
   - Review the header area/section should contain both title and description.
   - Make sure fields in sections are arranged to correct section and subsections.
   - Ensure the structure is one main General Information section with multiple subsections, not three separate sections.
     Enter prompt `prices and schedule entries are sub sections` to revise the plan.
   - If plan mentions header has general information and not in sections. Enter prompt `Header area does not contain general information` to revise plan.

> [!Note]
> The implementation plan generated by Cline may differ from the example shown below.
